								BIRD XMPP Bot
				(c) 2014 Pavel Spirek <pavel.spirek@nic.cz>
===============================================================================

This software allows to configure and control BIRD over XMPP protocol.

INSTALLATION:
The BIRDbot depends on loudmouth, glib-2.0, resolv and POSIX threads. It also
requires loudmouth and glib-2.0 headers to be installed on host system.

The BIRDbot is disabled by default and has to be enabled explicitly.

./configure --enable-birdbot
make
make install

CONFIGURATION:
BIRDbot can be configured with birdbot.conf file located in <prefix>/etc/
(see example).
Some options can be passed as command line arguments. If no XMPP password is
specified, neither in the .conf file nor as command line argument, BIRDbot
will prompt for it interactively (this only works in debug mode).

-d | --debug
Debug mode. Program will display debugging information instead of going to
background.

-4 | --force-ipv4
Force IPv4 resolution of XMPP server hostname.

-s | --nossl
Disable use of SSL connection with XMPP server.

-j | --jid
Specify BIRDbot's bare JID. This option overrides JID set in the configuration
file.

-w | --pass
Specify BIRDbot's XMPP password. This option overrides password set in the
configuration file.

-c | --socket
Set BIRD control socket.

-h | --help
Display this help and exit.
