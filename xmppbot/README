								BIRD XMPP Bot
				(c) 2014 Pavel Spirek <pavel.spirek@nic.cz>
===============================================================================

This software allows to configure and control BIRD over XMPP protocol.

INSTALLATION:
The BIRDbot depends on loudmouth, glib-2.0, resolv and POSIX threads. It also
requires loudmouth and glib-2.0 headers to be installed on host system.

The BIRDbot is disabled by default and has to be enabled explicitly.

./configure --enable-birdbot
make
make install

CONFIGURATION:
BIRDbot can be configured with birdbot.conf file located in <prefix>/etc/
(see example).
Some options can be passed as command line arguments. If no XMPP password is
specified, neither in the .conf file nor as command line argument, BIRDbot
will prompt for it interactively (this only works in debug mode).

-d | --debug
Debug mode. Program will display debugging information instead of going to
background.

-4 | --force-ipv4
Force IPv4 resolution of XMPP server hostname.

-n | --nossl
Disable use of SSL connection with XMPP server.

-j | --jid
Specify BIRDbot's bare JID. This option overrides JID set in the configuration
file.

-p | --pass
Specify BIRDbot's XMPP password. This option overrides password set in the
configuration file.

-s | --socket
Set BIRD control socket.

-h | --help
Display this help and exit.

USAGE:
A. Single-bot XMPP chat

	1. Add BIRDbot's JID to your XMPP client's roster. BIRDbot should authorize
	you automaticaly, if you are an authorized user specified in config file.
	2. Write "connect" for connection to BIRD
	3. Make configuration changes
	4. Finally, write "exit" or "quit" to disconnect from BIRD's control
	socket.

B. XMPP Multi-User Chat
BIRDbot also has a basic support of XMPP Multi-User Chat. This allows
configuration of more BIRD instances at the same time. This feature is
accesible only to BIRD superusers.

	1. Superuser must create a persistent MUC room on a trusted XMPP server.
	Access permissions to this room must be restricted to invited users only.
	Superuser must set his room nickname to his bare JID. This is used for
	distinction between various superusers in the room. 
	2. Add the room's JID to BIRDbot configuration file to the SUPERUSERS
	section.
	3. Send BIRDbot an invitation to join this MUC room. If BIRDbot has this
	room specified in the configuration file, it should enter and connect to
	BIRD immediately. Otherwise, it refuses the invitation. NOTE: Your XMPP
	client must support mediated invitations (see XEP-0045).
	4. Make configuration changes. All BIRDbots currently present in the room
	will react to your commands.
	5. To kick particular BIRDbot from the MUC room, just write	"exit" or
	"quit" command followed by BIRDbot's JID. If no JID is specified, this
	command will kick all BIRDbots present in the room.
