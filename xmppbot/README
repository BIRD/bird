BIRD XMPP Bot
(c) 2014 Pavel Spirek <pavel.spirek@nic.cz>
===========================================

This software allows to control BIRD over XMPP protocol.

INSTALLATION:

BIRDbot depends on loudmouth, glib-2.0, resolv and POSIX threads. It
also requires loudmouth and glib-2.0 headers to be installed on host
system.

BIRDbot is disabled by default and has to be enabled explicitly.

./configure --enable-birdbot
make
make install

CONFIGURATION:

BIRDbot can be configured with birdbot.conf file located in
<prefix>/etc/ (see example).

Some options can be passed as command line arguments. If no XMPP
password is specified, neither in the birdbot.conf file nor as command
line argument, BIRDbot will prompt for it interactively (this only
works in debug mode).

-d | --debug
Debug mode. Program will display debugging information instead of
going to background.

-4 | --force-ipv4
Force IPv4 resolution of XMPP server hostname.

-n | --nossl
Disable use of SSL connection with XMPP server.

-j | --jid
Specify BIRDbot's bare JID. This option overrides JID set in the
configuration file.

-p | --pass
Specify BIRDbot's XMPP password. This option overrides password set in
the configuration file.

-s | --socket
Set BIRD control socket.

-h | --help
Display this help and exit.

USAGE:

A. Single-bot XMPP chat

    1. Add BIRDbot's JID to your XMPP client's roster. BIRDbot should
       authorize you automaticaly, if you are an authorized user
       specified in config file.

    2. Start the chat by sending "connect".

    3. Send the same commands as in the CLI interface. Abbreviated
       keyword are supported as well.

    4. Finally, send "exit" or "quit" to disconnect from BIRD's
       control socket.

BIRDbot may be stopped by sending the command "haltbot".

B. XMPP Multi-User Chat

BIRDbot also has a basic support of XMPP Multi-User Chat. This allows
for controlling multiple BIRD instances at the same time. This feature
is accesible only to BIRD superusers.

    1. A superuser must create a persistent MUC room on a trusted XMPP
       server.  Access permissions to this room must be restricted to
       invited users only.  A superuser must set his room nickname to
       his bare JID. This is used for distinguishing various
       superusers in the room.

    2. Add the room's JID to the SUPERUSERS section of the BIRDbot
       configuration file.

    3. Using your Jabber client, invite any number of BIRDbots to join
       this MUC room. A BIRDbot that has this room specified in the
       configuration file will enter the room and be connect to the
       BIRD socket (the "connect" command is not
       necessary). Otherwise, it refuses the invitation. NOTE: Your
       XMPP client must support mediated invitations (see XEP-0045).

    4. Send commands as in a single-bot session. All BIRDbots
       currently present in the room will react to them.

    5. To kick particular BIRDbot out of the MUC room, just write
       "exit" or "quit" command followed by BIRDbot's JID. If no JID
       is specified, this command will kick all BIRDbots present in
       the room.
